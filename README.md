# Meridian Sandbox

## Install

To install and start this app:

1) `npm install`
2) `npm start`

## Development with local component library

1) `npm run dev:install`
2) `npm start`

This assumes you have locally cloned the [wrsinc/componentlib](https://github.com/wrsinc/componentlib)
and ran `npm link` in it. Developing locally means you will NOT be using the
version of the component library on NPM, but rather the symlinked version you
have in your sandbox.
